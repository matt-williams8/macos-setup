# macOS setup

An ansible based "backup" of my preferred macOS dev machine setup.

## Getting started

 1. "Prime" `pip3`
    * When getting started with macOS 12.X (Monterey) I found that just testing to see if `pip3` was installed triggered the xcode CLI tools install
    * `pip3`, `pip3 --version`, etc
 1. Download and run [`install.zsh`](install.zsh)
